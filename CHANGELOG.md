## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-24

### Security

- Audit the workflows with actionlint and zizmor in the lint job.
- Add the OpenSSF Scorecard workflow and its README badge.
- Limit the token permissions of every workflow.
- Stop persisting the checkout credentials where no step needs them.
- Pass template values to scripts through environment variables.
- Pin every action by commit SHA; Renovate keeps the digests current.
- Pin the kcov coverage image by digest; Renovate keeps it current.
- Attach a signed build provenance bundle (`*.intoto.jsonl`) to each release.
- Renovate takes its common rules from the shared preset `github>grigoriev/renovate-config`, which also turns on OSV vulnerability alerts.

### Added

- A Disclaimer section in the README.

### Fixed

- Run CI once per commit on a Renovate branch; a second push run blocked the automerge.
- Upload the files to the existing release on a rerun of the release workflow.
